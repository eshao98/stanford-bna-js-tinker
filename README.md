## Javascript learning exercise

### Introduction
The skill I set out to learn is to better familiarize myself with working with javascript event handlers, as well as using the `addEventListener()` function. Drawing from a problem area I encountered while building my portfolio website, I decided to specifically figure out how to have an image pop-up upon mouse hover over a link. 

My old solution to this issue involved using the `a:hover` selector a link within the CSS. This did not provide enough flexibility with the positioning or speed of the transition that I wanted. 

Specifically, I hoped that the task that I hoped to accomplish would include:

* an image pop-up on mousehover over a link
* while mousehover, image would follow/trail mouse movement 
* smooth, fade-in transition
* accomplish task using Vanilla JavaScript (no jQuery library)
